# Numerical and experimental investigation into the effect of friction stir weld variants on the crashworthiness of automobile top hat sections of dual phase steel 

I evaluated the resistance of three types of friction stir welds - ***spot, stitch and full***, to quasi-static axial crushing by studying the peak loads and energy absorption from their ***load-displacement curves***.

Here I've uploaded the *.inp* files for ABAQUS and the images of the experimental and numerical results. The *.odb* files are large in size so I've linked it from my drive below:
