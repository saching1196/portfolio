# Numerical and experimental investigation of ballistic performance of Aluminium Polycarbonate sandwich plates

I compared the impact resistances of ***monolithic Aluminum 1100 alloy, monolithic polycarbonate and a layered combination of both***, to bullet velocities ranging from ***350 m/s to 450 m/s***.

Here I've uploaded the *.cae* files for ABAQUS of the numerical results. These .cae files can only be viewed and run on ABAQUS 6.10
